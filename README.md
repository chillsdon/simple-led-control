# simple-led-control
CircuitPython designed to run on an Adafruit Trinket M0 to add some functionality to a strip of 3v LEDs

The original LED strip had a simple battery box with an on/off switch, which had a dodgy connection - instead of fixing it, I replaced it with a a Trinket M0 and a push button to toggle between 5 modes:

* 10% brightness
* 40% brightness
* 100% brightness
* Slow fade/pulse
* Fast fade/pulse

Also added an Adafruit 1000C Boost board with a 6000mah LiPoly battery (as I had them laying around).

Finished in a custom designed enclosure - 3D printed body with a laser cut perspex lid in which I mounted an on/off switch, a mode changing push button and a micro USB extention (for power and battery charging).
